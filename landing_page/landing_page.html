                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><blockquote>The person I interviewed was not of a common build. On one side they served in the military, doing physically challenging tasks for several years. 
                    On the other side, they enjoyed games and activities that some people would call nerdy. This subject served in the military for 5 years and even spend a year deployed over seas in Afghanistan. 
                    I did some research to find out what life was like during that time over seas and how it was similar and different than normal life here. The similarities were pretty surprising and not what I had expected. 
                    His hobbies are not what I would call common either. I did research into dungeons and dragons, and out door events like renaissance festivals. He has traveled to several states to attend various festivals.
                     The differences in them can be very vast. His enjoyment with table top games went deeper than just dungeons and dragons. He enjoys all sorts of board games, but not the typical Hasbro games like Monopoly. 
                     He talked about games like Munchkin, Defenders of the Realm, and other games that are not common in everyone household. From one extreme to the other, he was an interesting guy with several uncommon stories and encounters.</blockquote></p>
