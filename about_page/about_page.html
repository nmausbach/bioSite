            <p><blockquote>John is a pretty typical family guy with a wife, kids, and pets. 
                On the outside you would never be able to tell that he was a big fan of fantasy and fiction. Prior to joining the military he was going to school to become a nurse. 
                He didn’t really know what he wanted to do when he was young and this field was in high demand at the time. It seemed like at the very least he would be able to find work in that profession. 
                However, it didn’t take him very long to figure out that wasn’t what he really wanted to do forever. He always had a desire to join the military, serve his country, and see the world. 
                After 2 years of college, he left school and signed up for the armed forces. He became an artilleryman for the US Army. He spent a total of 5 years serving in the army and traveled all over the United States and Europe. 
                After serving a tour in Afghanistan he got injured and a year later left the military. This is when he met his wife and started his family. 
                He lived in Colorado for a time and became a Bronco fan. He said his wife’s family were big Bronco fans so he might as well join them too. At some point his family relocated to Omaha for better work opportunities. 
                Here he also discovered a love for role playing games. He found some like minded people and began to regularly play things like Dungeons and Dragons and other uncommon board games. 
                His whole family also started to love these games too. They even attend renaissance festivals locally and in other states. He continues to do these today and is looking forward to the next time his group of friends can gather and play more games together.</blockquote></p>
